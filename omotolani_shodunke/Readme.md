** This task was created using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript by Omotolani Shodunke.
I created a simple input where users can write what they intend to to, there is a plus icon to add the Todo to a list that comprises all the Todos.

When the todo is added, there are three buttons appended to the todo, these buttons can be used to mark the task as completed, remove that particular todo and also edit it. All the todos are saved to the local storage. 
Finally there is a clear task button that allows to clear all the todo list at once.
